Black-box adversarial attacks through speech distortion for speech emotion recognition

Black-box attack on three speech emotion recognition models
First, the data set is transformed into the spectral envelope in the speech distortion, 
and then the transformed speech data set is identified in three models (LSTM/GRAPH/MAA) to check the attack effect

对三种语音情绪识别模型进行黑盒攻击
首先将数据集在speech distortion中进行语谱包络变换，其次将变换后的语音数据集在三种模型（LSTM/GRAPH/MAA）中进行识别，检查攻击效果
